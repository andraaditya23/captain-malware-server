# 🚀 CAPTAIN MALWARE

This skripsi-project is a **malware detection system** that utilizes both **machine learning** and **YARA rule-based** methods for detecting malicious files.

## 📚 Code Files Overview

- `server/api/detect.py`: The main server-side script that handles HTTP requests, accepting a file for analysis and applying machine learning or YARA detection as requested by the client.

- `server/api/machinelearning.py`: Provides helper functions for extracting necessary information from PE files which is then used for the machine learning detection.

- `server/api/yaradetection.py`: This module provides the YARA rule-based detection functionality and sends an alert email when malware is detected.

- `client/detection.py`: The client-side script that sends a file for analysis to the server using either machine learning or YARA detection.

## 🚀 Usage

**To Start The CAPTAIN MALWARE System**, Follow these steps:

## 🎯 Server and Client
Start the server by running the detect.py script in the server/api directory.

```bash
python server/api/detect.py
```

This will start the Flask server which hosts the API endpoints for file upload and processing.

**Once the server is up and running, you can send a file to the server for analysis by running the detection.py script in the client directory.**

```bash
python client/detection.py <file_path>
```

Replace <file_path> with the path to the file you wish to analyze.
